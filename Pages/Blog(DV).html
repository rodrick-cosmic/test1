            <h2>THE CONCEPT OF DATA VISUALIZATION</h2>
            <div class="underline"></div>
          </div>
          
          <p>
            <p>The term “data visualization”, although rather simple sounding, refers to a slightly more complex set of concepts. </p>

            A comprehensive definition could be, data visualization is the process of visualizing data to make it easier for the human brain to comprehend and draw conclusions from it. It often aims to make it simpler to see patterns, trends, and outliers in huge data sets. 
            Practically every profession requires the capacity to visualize data. 
            Computer scientists often use it to improve artificial intelligence (AI), a worked example of this is how AI software often has a pipeline-like structure with several processes that interact with one another in intricate ways. 
            The use of graphics like flowcharts or even graphs can assist AI developers and people who are worried about the adoption of AI systems explain and comprehend systems. 
            CEOs can use it to interact with stakeholders by simplifying complex and oftentimes large figures and condensing it into digestible charts that can be quickly and easily understood. </p>
            Arguably the biggest users of data visualization (who aren’t involved in big data) are teachers who use it to display test results for pupils, and use graphs to explain trends and changes in surveys for example.
             Initiatives using big data also depend on it. In the early days of the big data movement, businesses acquired vast amounts of data and needed a way to get a broad perspective of their data rapidly and easily. 
            Now with this context we can turn to Embodying Data: Chinese Aesthetics, Interactive Visualization and Gaming Technologies, and specifically chapter 2, “Overview of Data Visualization”. </p>
            Off the bat, Li, explains the importance of data visualization and providing the reader with the historical context that even predates modern technology such as computers. I find this point interesting as, prior to the reading upon hearing the term, ‘data visualization’, I would always think of data in the more technological sense, and never once thought of it in the sense that the concept of data visualization has existed for quite some time, and that it has merely moved from medium to medium (rock paintings, stone tablets or even paper to modern computers, smartphones, websites)</p>
            Li then goes on to bring up the advantages associated with data visualization these being. <br> </p> Firstly, huge quantities of data may be instantly represented. 
        </p><br> Secondly, It helps users to rapidly see emergent qualities (like patterns) in data which allow for development of fresh insights. 
    </p> <br>Thirdly, it may be utilized for product quality control, wherein data analysis enables the quick detection of issues. 
</p><br>And Lastly it improves knowledge of both large and small-scale data.
</p>
            However, data visualization is, of course, capable of so much more. 
            One key element I think Li overlooks is the obvious advantage that a visual representation affords – humans react much better to visual stimulus. Fundamentally the human brain is programmed for visualization, and as such is far faster to respond than if reading data as pure text. 
            While referencing Marai (2010) and Post et al. (2003) Ji notes that information visualization and scientific visualization are the two main sub-divisions of data visualization. 
            Wherein information visualization is used to graphically portray abstract data, such as business data. </p>

            In contrast to scientific visualization which is used to show physical-based scientific data such as the human body. 
            Upon further research a paper written by Henrik R. Nagel and published by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, reveals that Card et al.  
            Defines Scientific Visualization and Information Visualization respectively as, the process of enhancing cognition through the use of interactive, physically based visual representations of scientific facts and enhancing cognition through the use of interactive visual representations of abstract, non-physical data. (Nagel, n.d.)</p>

            This is interesting as it brings us to our next point, what is data?</p>

            According to Li, “Data is raw and simply exists.” (Li, 2020). Data can also be broken down into two unique types, primary and secondary. 
            Primary data refers to information created by the researcher, such as results of surveys, interviews, and experiments, carried out specifically to identify and address the current study issue. 
            Thus the use of pre-existing data produced by the government for organizational record-keeping purposes is known as secondary data. </p>
            
            
            Therefore data could be considered as a collection of raw and unorganized facts, which on its own has little to no intrinsic value, however it is when the data is turned into information, that it becomes useful.</p>
             This is because ‘information’ seeks to organize these facts into context that can be understood. (Hill, 2021). </p>
             Data visualization distils this process even further, as it provides an entirely new way to contextualize the data, that being through visuals. Speaking of visuals, something that is definitely worth mentioning is the “tree-map” (Li, 2020), which Li (referencing Manuel Lima) refers to as the “one of the earliest visual illustrations of human thought systems” (Li, 2020). </p>
              This got me thinking about how data visualization and data handling has evolved over time, one particular thought I had was in regard to data visualization. One other affordance of data visualization is the aspect that it is a lot more cross-cultural than data (complex numbers and equations), by that I mean in general it is much easier for the average person to comprehend otherwise cumbersome information. </p>
            Additionally Li outlines other data visualization methodology, such as maps, scatter plots, charts, tables, diagrams, graphs, waveform, and volume. These are all fairly explanatory, however I believe it is worth understanding a basic idea of three most widely used and arguably most important. Maps, according to some estimates, ancient maps date back as far as 16,500 B.C. and have been a part of human history for thousands of years. 
        </p>However, the earliest known maps date to approximately 2300 B.C. and are found on stone tablets from Babylon. (Maps International, 2012). In more modern times, maps have become a lot more portable and easy to use, Google Maps is a good example. Google Maps has various functionality that helps users understand their immediate and even distant surroundings by providing visuals, and different levels of visualization. </p>
           For instance, there are a number of distinct map views available in Google Maps, including topography, satellite, and the default (simple map view). These maps may be enhanced with overlays for street view, 3D, COVID-19 data, air quality, transport, traffic, biking, and wildfires.</p>
            Mainly used in scientific publications, scatter plots are a type of data visualization that shows how different variables are related to one another. This data is displayed using several data points that are positioned between an x- and y-axis. The name of this type of data visualization comes from how these data points appear to be "scattered" throughout the graph. Finding any patterns or links between two variables is the goal of using a scatter plot, also known as a scatter diagram or an x-y graph, these are data visualizations that have become synonymous not only in the scientific fields but mathematical ones too.</p>
            One data visualization method that is no doubt familiar to most is the simple chart. Charts can be used as line, bar, or pie graphs, according to Li, when representing quantitative data that conveys information about sizes or dimensions, bar graphs are highly helpful. This notion however may be incorrect, as bar charts or pie charts are often used to display categorical data and with that logic these types of displays are not appropriate for quantitative data. Reason being, quantitative data is often displayed using either a histogram, dot plot, or a stem-and-leaf plot. (Thangarajah, 2020)
            In conclusion, Li’s insight and observations regarding data visualization are, although lacking to some degree of nuance and sometimes coming off as unrelated, extremely helpful in understanding the basics of data, Li offers various levels of how data is transformed, reinterpreted, and even sourced. Arguably the most in depth and engaging sections result from Li’s observations regarding data visualization in relation to human perception, wherein Li discusses how the sensory affects our perception of information. One of the biggest gripe’s I found with the reading was that it felt like many thoughts were not entirely Li and instead Li quoting various other academics, and while there is no inherent issue in doing so, I believe it became so much that Li’s own observations and voice were seemingly drowned out.
