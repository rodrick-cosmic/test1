                    <p> From the get go I was in a state of cofusion, I had almost no idea regarding what kind of website I wanted to make.
                        The nice part about last semester's submissions was that it was a clear cut portfolio site so you kinda knew exactly what you were getting into
                    
                    </p>
                    
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <section class="about" id="about">
            <div class="max-width">
               
                <div class="about-content">
                    <div class="column left">
                        <img src="/images/2.jpg" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <div class="column right">
                        <div class="text"> <span class="typing-2"></span></div>
                        <p> The biggest blessing and curse of this assignment was how much creative freedom we were afforded, essentially, we were given the opportunity to create whatever kind of site we wanted, because there was no longer a set of rules or creative restrictions we needed to follow.
                            Naturally, I was stumped for a while, wondering what kind of site I wanted to make and how I was going to intergrate the data visualization elements into it. Then one day I was thinking about statistics and my favorite movies crossed my mind, so I thought why not have a data visualization of my favorite movies.
                            Then I wondered how would I even begin to tackle the actual site design. So I intially thought of having it be one of those movie streaming sites, needlessly to say it did not quite feel right.

                        <div class="column left">

                            <p> So I started visiting sites that had a sleek bleeding edge aesthetic to them, ones that looked like they were from the future, and of these I came across a very particular site...

                        <div class="about-content">
                            <div class="column left">
                                <img src="/images/4.jfif" alt="My face should be here!">

                                <p> In the lead up to release of Matrix Resurrections, Warner Bros. launched a website, that is arguably one of the coolest things I have ever experienced, the gimmick is that the website reads your computer's date and time and responds to that in real-time, with actual VOICE ACTING.
                                    However, that was not neccessarily what interested me, what interested me was the overall aesthetic associated with the site. I am a massive fan of The Matrix series so I thought why not build a site that best encapsulated elements from the film.

                    <section class="about" id="about">
                        <div class="max-width">
                            
                            <div class="about-content">
                                <div class="column left">
                                    <img src="/images/5.webp" alt="My face should be here!">
                                </div>
                                <div class="column right">

                                    <p> Two websites stood out to me in particular, 
                                        both of which are mock-up designs made by fans trying their luck at designing tie-in websites. 
                                        The first site was designed by Oti Gutierrez,  the site was a bit too bland for the vision I had, but I really liked the UI and the overall design, I think for the purpose of being a marketing website it works, but it feels souless, 
                                        as many of these movie tie-in websites tend to be.

                                </div>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <section class="about" id="about">
                            <div class="max-width">
                                
                                <div class="about-content">
                                    <div class="column left">
                                        <img src="/images/6.webp" alt="My face should be here!">
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="column right">
                                        <div class="text"> <span class="typing-2"></span></div>
                                        <p> The second site, designed by Nick Covaleff, demonstrated more lively and colorful aspects, 
                                            and I wanted to pursue this but overall I wanted my site to be as simple as possible. 
                                            Last semester much of my aesthetic value was placed in trying to make the colors and and the layout as simple as possible, 
                                            this semester is no different.  <a href="https://dribbble.com/wirel">https://dribbble.com/wirel</a>
